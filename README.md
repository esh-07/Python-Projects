# Portfolio
This contains few of my Python personal projects. You can find multiple of my passion projects only in Python here like in Machine learning as well as basic programming like Hangman from my 100 days of Python course. This collection showcases a variety of Python projects that demonstrate my growth as a programmer and my diverse interests in the field. From beginner-friendly games like Hangman to more advanced Machine Learning applications, these projects represent my journey through the 100 Days of Python course and beyond.
Some highlights you might find include:

A text-based Hangman game that implements basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.
Data analysis projects using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, where I've explored various datasets and derived meaningful insights.
Machine Learning models built with scikit-learn and TensorFlow, tackling problems in areas like image classification, natural language processing, or predictive analytics.
Web scraping scripts that demonstrate my ability to collect and process data from online sources.
